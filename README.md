# DANs Deli and Meats

## Description
This is our Database Management Term Project. We have built an application for a butcher shop where
customers can place orders and workers with proper access can make changes to prices, and view
reports based on pounds sold of each product.

## To run the application
- Make sure you have NodeJS installed on your machine
- Do the following in seperated terminal instances (bash is preferred)
- **cd** into DANsDeliandMeats and run **npm install --force**
- **cd** into DANsDeliandMeats-service and run **npm isntall --force**
- Once that is completed in both terminal windows go back to the first window and run **ng serve**
- In the second terminal window run **npm start app.js**
- Application will be accessible on web browser at **localhost:4200**
